# SOLANA PROGRAM STARTER APP NEXTJS + TAILWIND

### TODOS
- Make useWalletBalance work as expected
- Test with multiple string sizes and how to measure that in characters based on what is on the contract storage space
- Test with multiple additions to the vector (like, a TON). Create a loop for that
- Save the initialized account in local storage and make them manageable
